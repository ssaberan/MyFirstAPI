# My Personal API

Not sure yet what I want to make this do.

## Usage

Install the necessary dependencies (if not already installed)

```
npm i
```

Start the dev server

```
npm run start:dev
```

Then hit the endpoint `localhost:4000/api/liveCheck` to see it working. It should return "The API is live!".

## Production endpoint

This API is currently deployed to `https://ss-personal-api.herokuapp.com`. You can check if it is live by hitting the endpoint, `https://ss-personal-api.herokuapp.com/api/liveCheck`.

## Available endpoints

-  `/api/liveCheck`
-  `/api/htmlStringResume`
-  `/api/pdfResume`
